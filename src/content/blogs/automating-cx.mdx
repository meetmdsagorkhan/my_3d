## The Problem: Scaling Support Without Scaling Costs

At **Priyo Pay**, we faced a common challenge: as our user base grew, so did our support tickets. We were hitting a **24-hour response time**, which wasn't acceptable for a fintech company dealing with people's money.

## The Solution: AI Agents & Automation

Instead of just hiring more agents, I implemented an automated triage system using **n8n** (workflow automation) and **OpenAI**.

Here is how the workflow looks:
1.  **Ingestion:** User sends an email or chat message.
2.  **Analysis:** An AI agent analyzes the sentiment and categorizes the issue (e.g., "KYC", "Transaction Failed", "General Inquiry").
3.  **Action:** * If it's a simple FAQ, the AI drafts a response for review.
    * If it's complex, it routes it to the specific specialist (Compliance Team vs. Support Team).

## The Results

The impact was immediate:
* **Response Time:** Dropped from 24 hours to **<1 hour**.
* **Efficiency:** Manual workload reduced by **50%**.
* **CSAT:** Scores improved significantly as users got instant acknowledgments.

## Conclusion

Automation isn't about replacing humans; it's about freeing them up to do the complex, empathetic work that machines can't touch.
